# Data Classification : Public
# The contents of this file are meant to be publicly accessible and this file contains no private data

# NOTE: authorized_groups and authorized_users control two things independently:
#
# 1. Does the SSO Dashboard display a tile to the user for this application?
#
#        No, if display: false.
#            No SSO users can see the tile.
#
#        Maybe, if display: true.
#            If groups/users are defined,
#                The user must be a member of them to see the tile.
#            Otherwise,
#                All SSO users (including the general public) can see the tile.
#
# 2. Does Auth0 restrict SSO access to this application by group or user?
#
#        No, if client_id is missing.
#            All SSO users (including the general public) can access the app.
#
#        Maybe, if client_id is defined.
#            If groups/users are defined,
#                The user must be a member of them to access the application.
#            Otherwise,
#                All SSO users (including the general public) can access the app.

# NOTE: MFA is generally required, following these rules:
#
# 1. If the client_id is missing, MFA is not required. (This is uncommon.)
#
# 2. If `AAL: LOW` is present, MFA is not required. (This is uncommon.)
#
# 3. Otherwise, MFA is required.
#
#    After a user logs in with one of the supported methods (ldap, fxa, etc);
#    the auth method will inform us if the user's account has MFA set up.
#
#    Access will be denied if the user doesn't have MFA configured.
#
#    Users need to configure MFA using the appropriate process for their
#    chosen auth method. LDAP is well-understood; for other methods, enabling
#    passkeys, authenticators, and/or other MFA methods can be done at:
#
#    FxA/MzA: https://accounts.firefox.com/settings#two-step-authentication
#    GitHub: https://github.com/settings/security
#    Google: https://myaccount.google.com/security#recovery
#    Email: (not supported)
